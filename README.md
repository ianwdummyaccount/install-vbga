# install-vbga.sh

This is a shell script that automates the process of installing
VirtualBox Guest Additions under Kali Linux.

It probably won't work for other Linux distros (different package names
etc.).

## Download and run

Do the following:

	git clone https://github.com/ianwdummyaccount/install-vbga.git
	cd install-vbga
	./install-vbga.sh
